The point of this progect it to make a game, I decided on doing this becuase it was a progect I had 
already started work on.




Frankly I don't understand what else you want me to put in here.
all I know is that I added the things you told me to and now my program is compleatly broken
It worked before, but now it is throwing all types of errors that I have no Idea what they mean.
The NUnit flies keep on flip flopping of wether or not they want to give an error, and a lot of things
broke in the obj/Debug folder.
